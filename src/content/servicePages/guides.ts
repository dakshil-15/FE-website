 * on their behalf) needs to understand what the service is, what is included, how it runs and how it is judged.
 *
 * Writing rules: explain the discipline plainly; describe First Economy's work only as the site already does
 * (process steps, case-study results, listed tools); every figure must trace to a case study or stats file;
 * never state timelines, prices, minimum budgets or guaranteed outcomes — the site does not publish them.
 * Headings are question- or topic-led so a passage still reads correctly when quoted on its own.

People now get answers from Google’s AI Overviews, assistants such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity, and the classic results page, often in the same session. This guide explains what each discipline does and how First Economy runs them as one programme.",

          "SEO (search engine optimisation) makes a site easy for search engines to crawl, understand and rank, so the right pages appear when people search. AEO (answer engine optimisation) structures content so that search features and assistants can lift a short, direct answer from it. GEO (generative engine optimisation) builds the clarity and credibility that make AI tools cite a brand and describe it accurately when they write an answer.",
          "They are layers, not rivals. Good SEO is the foundation: pages an engine cannot crawl cannot be quoted either. AEO sits on top, shaping pages around the questions people actually ask. GEO extends that to the wider web, because generative tools learn about a brand from many sources, not only its own site.",

A page can influence a decision without earning a click, and a brand can lose ground simply because an assistant describes a competitor more clearly. The goal therefore widens from ranking to being the source an engine trusts enough to quote.",

For Royale Touché, community content on Reddit led to a 4.9/5 LLM rating and citations in ChatGPT.",
